Day 1 : Time Complexity
Understanding the concepts of Time Complexity.

What is Time Complexity?
The amount of time taken by an algorithm to run is called Time Complexity.

Measurement of Time Complexity:

1. Lower Bound
The notation Ω(n) is the formal way to express the lower bound of an algorithm's running time. 
It measures the best case time complexity or the best amount of time an algorithm can possibly 
take to complete.

2. Upper Bound
This notation is known as the upper bound of the algorithm, or a Worst Case of an algorithm.
It tells us that a certain function will never exceed a specified time for any value of input n.

3. Tight Bound
When we say tight bounds, we mean that the time compexity represented by the Big-Θ notation 
is like the average value or range within which the actual time of execution of the algorithm 
will be.
